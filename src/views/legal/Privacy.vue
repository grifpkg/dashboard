        <p><strong>hCaptcha</strong></p>
        <p>We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by
            Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data
            entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an
            automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based
            on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app
            visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates
            various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse
            movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha
            analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background. Website or app visitors
            are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge. Data
            processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a
            legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a "data
            processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the
            purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's
